                        Ireland, and as soon as we landed at Shannon airport I felt more at home than
                        I&#39;d ever felt in Minnesota. After two weeks walking country lanes I wondered,

                            editor to pay the rent on a hundred-year old stone cottage that I&#39;d found online.

            <h1 class="story-title">Tree Story</h1>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>You could say it was a tree that led me to writing. I was ten. My family had just moved to a new house in a new suburb called New Hope, which my mother will soon dub "No Hope". It was the first house in a new development, with no other houses or playmates yet around. For a time, until the next baby was born, I had a room of my own. From my window on the second floor of our white clapboard 'Colonial' I looked out over a flat, treeless yard to fields of tumbled corn beyond. It was the last crop that would ever be harvested in that section of New Hope, soon to be planted with avenues and cul de sacs of homes for newly-minted middle-class families like ours.</p>

                <p>The literary events in memory that year were the visit by the encyclopedia salesman and a special assembly in the school gymnasium to hear the white-shocked Carl Sandburg thump against our somnolence with his startling gravelled diction. The occasion was the dedication of our new Carl Sandburg Junior High School. Although I was book prone, like my mother, it hadn't occurred to me that you could chose to be a writer. Anyway, I was set to be a ballet dancer and longing for my first pair of toe shoes.</p>

                <p>Then came the tree—in a powerful technicolor dream complete with surround sound and thrilling plot. The tree was thick-stalked and burled, with fissured bark and a lush canopy. A hobbit-size door led me inside the tree, down a flight of tiny stairs, and into a story far from the order of the world I lived in. My ears were still ringing when I woke up, and the pale blue walls of my room seemed slightly tilted. An oneiric spell was on me, and I didn't want to let it go. Still in my pajamas, I went straight to the card table under the window, where I usually did my homework, and started to write.</p>

                <p>By the time my mother broke through the dream state to insist I come down for breakfast, my fevered pencil script covered a tablets-worth of three-line school paper. And I was no where near finished—I had already decided my story was big enough for a book. After breakfast were chores, and after that, well, I don't remember. Eventually I got back to my table and picked up my pencil. But the messy pile of pages—my book to be—was gone. I looked all around my room. My mother had cleaned, that was obvious, as she had threatened to do if I didn't clean up myself. She said she threw all those old papers in the incinerator. And yes, she had burned them, and no, it was too late.</p>

                <p>I went back to my room. I would have to start over. I picked up my pencil, but no words came. I'd lost my story. I could not get back to the magic world inside the tree.</p>

                <p>Although it took years for me to accept that my instrument for facing life was a pencil or a pen and not the ballet barre, the tree never left me. I can still feel the force of its sheltering essence. I can still feel its pull to another world. That tree planted itself when I first tried to write its story. That tree, rooted and solid, with its door to our human past in the natural world, where trees were once gods and alphabets, remains my muse. Always with me, yet always elusive, like a dream.</p>

                <p>This experience taught me early that you need to be at your desk, chores or no chores, or you'll lose your story. It also taught me to hide my first drafts, but I still prefer to write in my pajamas.</p>
